## ðŸ§ª Steps Followed

1. **Importing Libraries**  
   Loaded necessary packages for data handling, modeling, and plotting.
2. **Loading Data**  
   Read the dataset from CSV or other sources.
3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Checked for missing values  
   - Performed feature scaling and encoding  
   - Handled outliers (if any)
4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Created new features or selected important ones for training.
5. **Modeling using XGBoost**  
   - Trained a regression model  
   - Tuned hyperparameters (if included)
6. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluated performance using:
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - RÂ² Score (Goodness of Fit)
7. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted actual vs predicted values  
   - Visualized feature importance
